    <b>What are the research questions?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We are interested in determining whether or not exposure to different contingencies affects learning for future non-contingent cues and outcomes.

    <b>How does this study extend on previous research on this topic?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Illusory causation is a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe there is a causal relationship between a non-contingent cue and outcome. Previous research has suggested that illusory causation is a temporary error in learning that disappears over extended training, although the current literature has been unable to reliably demonstrate this. We are testing an alternative account of illusory causation: rather than being an erroneously acquired belief over training, illusory causation is the result of strong prior beliefs in a cue-outcome relationship that does not normalise after presenting non-contingent cue-outcome pairings.

    <b>What are some potential real-world implications of this research?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Illusory causation is often used as an in-lab analogue of how people mistakenly perceive causal relationships in the real-world (e.g. superstitious beliefs, endorsement of alternative medicines). Our research aims to model the psychological mechanisms that produce illusory causation, so that we may understand how to prevent the phenomenon from occurring.

    <b>Briefly describe a potential issue (e.g., ethical, practical) or limitation of the study (e.g., design, ecological validity). </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Participants might believe that the experiment is a test of their intelligence. We have attempted to resolve this by emphasising that there are no correct answers and we are only interested in what and how participants learn within the experiment.

    <b>Briefly describe the study methodology (e.g., design, dependent/ independent variables, materials).</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Participants complete a causal learning task on a computer, where they are required to determine the relationship between a cue and an outcome. Participants are exposed to two contingencies, and learn them one at a time. Three conditions differed by the type of contingency in the first cue-outcome pair. Causal ratings were recorded after every block of training, as well as a pre-test (a test-phase before any training begins).
